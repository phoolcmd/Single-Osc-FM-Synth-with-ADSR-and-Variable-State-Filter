# Single-Osc-FM-Synth-with-ADSR-and-Variable-State-Filter

This is a basic synthesizer built in the JUCE API. It features a single oscilator FM synth with ADSR envelope, variable state filter, and mod envelope.
I made this synth by following the Audio Programmer tutorials on youtube. You can find that here: https://www.youtube.com/@TheAudioProgrammer
