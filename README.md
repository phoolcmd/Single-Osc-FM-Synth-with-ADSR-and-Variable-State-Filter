# Single-Osc-FM-Synth-with-ADSR-and-Variable-State-Filter

**FM Synthesizer with ADSR and Variable State Filter**
This is a basic synthesizer built using the JUCE API. It features a single oscillator FM synth with ADSR envelope, variable state filter, and modulation envelope. This synthesizer is suitable for producing a wide range of sounds, from classic bell-like FM timbres to more complex, evolving textures.

****Building from Source******
To build this synthesizer from source, you'll need to follow these steps:

Download and install the Projucer IDE from the JUCE website.
Set up your development environment by installing XCode on Mac or Visual Studio on Windows.
Open the Single-Osc-FM-Synth-with-ADSR-and-Variable-State-Filter.jucer file in Projucer.
Make any necessary changes to the project settings, such as adding additional modules or changing the output directory.
Export the project to your desired build format (XCode or Visual Studio) and build the project.

**Overview**
The FM Synthesizer with ADSR and Variable State Filter is a single oscillator synthesizer built using the JUCE API. It features the following components:

Oscillator: A single oscillator with adjustable frequency and depth controls.
ADSR Envelope: An ADSR envelope with adjustable attack, decay, sustain, and release times.
Variable State Filter: A variable state filter with adjustable cutoff frequency and resonance controls.
Modulation Envelope: A modulation envelope with adjustable attack, decay, sustain, and release times.

**Programming Concepts**
During the development of this synthesizer, several key programming concepts were learned and implemented. These include:

Object-oriented programming principles: The use of object-oriented programming principles to design and implement the various components of the synthesizer, including encapsulation and inheritance.
Digital signal processing (DSP): The use of DSP techniques to process audio signals, including techniques such as filtering and envelope shaping.
JUCE API: The use of the JUCE API to develop audio plugins and applications, including the use of the JUCE GUI library to create a custom user interface.
